The `public/favicon.ico` file is typically a small icon file used as the favicon for a website. It's not a code file that requires implementation, but rather an image file that should be placed in the `public` directory of your Next.js project.

As this is an image file, I can't generate or provide the actual binary content. However, I can explain how it should be used in the context of your FitTrack MVP:

1. Create or obtain a favicon image file named `favicon.ico`.
2. Place this file in the `public` directory of your Next.js project.
3. Next.js will automatically serve this file at the root of your website.

No additional code is required to implement or use the favicon. The browser will automatically request and display the favicon from the `/favicon.ico` path.

To ensure the favicon is properly recognized by all browsers, you may want to include a link tag in your `_document.js` or `_app.js` file:

```jsx
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

This link tag is typically included by default in Next.js projects, so you may not need to add it manually.

Remember to create a high-quality favicon that represents your FitTrack brand well, as it will be displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks.
