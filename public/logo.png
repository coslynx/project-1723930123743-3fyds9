I understand that you're asking for the complete implementation of the `public/logo.png` file for the FitTrack MVP. However, it's important to note that `logo.png` is an image file, not a code file. As such, it doesn't contain any executable code or require implementation in the traditional sense.

The `public/logo.png` file should be an actual PNG image file that represents the logo for the FitTrack application. This image file would typically be created by a graphic designer and placed in the `public` directory of the project.

Since you're asking for code output, I can't provide the actual image content. Instead, I can explain how this file would be used in the context of the FitTrack MVP:

1. The `logo.png` file should be placed in the `public` directory of the Next.js project.

2. It can be referenced in components, such as the `Header.tsx` file, using Next.js's `Image` component:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image src="/logo.png" alt="FitTrack Logo" width={40} height={40} />
```

3. The dimensions (width and height) used in the `Image` component should match the actual dimensions of the logo image file.

4. The logo image should be optimized for web use, with an appropriate file size and resolution for fast loading.

5. It's important to ensure that the logo file actually exists in the specified location to prevent broken image links in the application.

Remember, the actual content of `public/logo.png` would be binary image data, not text or code. If you need to create or modify the logo, you would use an image editing software, not a code editor.
